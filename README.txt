This is the Volunteer Event Registration Module.
As an administrator you will be able to
1. set the Registration Event

Stations are created separately and independently.

The registration form allows the volunteer to select stations.

stations on her behalf.

Only a single registration may be saved per volunteer per event.

Closed stations can not be selected.

Code needs to be added to prevent 'data save conflict'
